- **Working memory limits**: Can't hold multiple financial metrics in mind

### Current Pain Points

1. **"Where did my money go?"** - Genuinely doesn't know
2. **Month-end panic** - Runs out before salary
3. **Shame spiral** - Knows they overspend, feels bad, spends to cope
4. **Avoidance** - Doesn't want to look at finances (scary)
5. **All-or-nothing** - Either extreme budget or no budget

### What Alex NEEDS (not wants)

| **Celebration of wins** | Dopamine from saving, not just spending |
| **Gentle accountability** | Not shaming, but tracking |
| **Simple daily goal** | Just today, not the whole month |

## Emotional Design Principles

1. **Safe > Productive**: Fear = avoidance
2. **Progress > Perfection**: Any tracking is good tracking
3. **Today > Forever**: ADHD brain can't do "lifetime savings"
4. **Permission > Restriction**: "You CAN spend, here's how much"
5. **Celebration > Shame**: Dopamine from wins, not fear of failure
